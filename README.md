LazyLoad
========

Lazy load images in JavaScript

Instead of placing the image's url in the src
attribute, place it within a data attribute
called data-url.

Then give all the elements you need to lazy
load a class called "lazyload".

You can change the class name and data attribute
in the config variable.

Call the lazyload method to load your assets.
